- 👋 Hey There, I am Arnab.
- 👀 I’m interested in working on other's program on my free time trying to improve on it or fix bugs if they exist.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make backend requests from server so that I can use my personal projects so that they can work with live data instead of feeding it data that is only available as a predefined dataset
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning Codes and Image Recognization using Machine Learning
- 📫 How to reach me: drop me a mail at: gamingarnabyt@gmail.com or hit me up in discord with username: Agent NotSoLazy#8151
- 😊 If you are wondering why is there no repository or anything on my github account it is because I have either taken them down or turned off the visblity as I am very bad at organizing files so I'm taking my time to clean stuff up before I present them again. ;)
